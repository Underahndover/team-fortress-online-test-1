<p> Hello, and welcome to my new (and first) WEBSITE! I created this website with the intention of making my own personal space where i can talk about whatever i like, and what i like is Team Fortress 2. Please understand that eventhough I love Team Fortress 2 and I would GLADLY die for a free hat, I will say its not my only passion, dont be surpised if every now and again I talk about Halo, Movies, or something not so Dorky :D. I would also like to mention that this site is far from finished but I think it would be fun to keep it online while I make changes to it maybe this is a bad idea/plan for the future :/ but hey, whos to say? Anyways, thats it for now. I might make a credits section so that people can know who is the name of the all powerful text they are talking to, bye!</p>
